1)	Introduction:

Event listing application is designed using Node.JS, AngularJS and RESTful services. It uses MongoDB as a back-end database.
The application provides features for creating a new event, modify any existing event (update/delete).

2)	Setting up the environment:

For running the application one is required to install NodeJS, Angular JS and MongoDB in the system to begin with.

Step1: Create a folder named nodeprojects in C:\ drive.

Step 2: Create a project folder named eventlistapp inside the nodeprojects folder.

Step 3: Open a command prompt (CMD or gitbash) and install the modules required for node viz. body-parser, mongojs, express as shown below:

Step 4: Once all the modules have been installed correctly create folder named public inside eventlistapp folder.
Copy the index.html file inside the public folder.

Step 5: Create folder named controllers inside the eventlistapp folder and copy the controller.js file inside controllers folder.

Step 6: Copy the server.js file to the main eventlistapp folder

Step 7: Create a folder data inside the C:\ drive and create a folder named db inside the data folder.
MongoDB will use this folder.

Step 8: Through the command prompt insert the sample data by running the insert script in the insert.txt file. Once, the data is inserted, youâ€™ll see that once the site loads.
 
3)	Running the application:

Step 1: First navigate to the directory where MongoDB is being installed. Navigate to the bin folder and start Mongod.exe process.

Step 2: Open one more command prompt and start mongo.exe process and type use eventlist to use that database.

Step 3: Start another command prompt, navigate to the nodeprojects>eventlistapp and start the node server

Step 4: Once server is started, go to the web browser and type localhost:3003 You should see the project running.
